# TestRepo
testing repo for learning repo control

To commit to this repository, you must first creast a pull request from another branch/fork. The repository moderators will then review the pull requests and approve or suggest changes/deny it. Always try to make sure you are not working on the same issue as someone else, as it can create file conflicts when merging into the main branch.
